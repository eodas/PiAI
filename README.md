This is a skill for picroft that will interact with the GPIO

## About 
This Skill demonstrates how to interact with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins using a Mycroft Skill. This Skill shows both reading data from a GPIO port (detecting a button press) and writing data to the port (illuminating an LED). 

### Preparation

[You will need to first install the GPIO libraries for Picroft, and add some additional permissions](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/#using-the-gpio-pins-on-the-raspberry-pi-3).

### Installing from the `makefile`

* Change the Makefile IP address for the RPi installation to the IP address of your RPi. 

That is, edit the file `makefile` using your favorite editor like `nano` or `vi`. 

The line you will need to change is `scp -r * pi@192.168.205.115:/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`. 

Change this to have the IP address of your RPi. 

* Create the folder ```/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio``` on the RPi for the installer. 

You can do this by using the command `mkdir /opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`

* Build the code using the `makefile`.  ```make install.pi```

### Notes

If the LED blinking is too fast, it will be difficult to get a command to execute because there will be a voice response when the the LED turns off and on. Turn the blinking to a lower frequency to be able to execute commands. 

## Using

Once installed on a paired Picroft you should be able to issue commands:

## Examples 
* "Turn Device on"
* "Turn Device off"
* "Blink Device"
* "Device status"

and the Picroft will respond with the following:

```
Led is Off
Led is On
Button Pressed
Button Released
```

## Files

    vocab - This captures entities used by the skill to understand the vocal command.
    dialog - This is used for responces back to the users.

The power of the IoT (Internet of Things) device increases greatly when business process (jBPM) can use them to provide information
about our real-world as well as execute IoT (devices) as part of our business process. The jBPM-BPMN modular allow us to define 
both the Business Processes and IoT Devices Behavior at the same time using one diagram. With EOSpy adding Drools-jBPM to IoT,
we make the IoT devices â€œsmartâ€�. Moving beyond just collecting IoT data and transitioning, to leveraging the new wealth of IoT data, 
to improving the smart decision making is the key. Executive Order EOSpy Arduino Tron AI-IoT will help these IoT devices, environments 
and products to self-monitor, self-diagnose and eventually, self-direct.

RPi IoT Tron Java â€” Automation Alert Monitoring â€“ A Java version of the RPi IoT Tron â€“ Executive Order Sensor Processor System Client.
 
The RPi IoT Tron Java Client application allows you to transmit automation and remote monitoring system information directly to the EOSPY Server 
from your own Java application. Monitor buildings, servers, vehicles and people from anywhere in the world and post there status and condition 
directly to the EOSPY Server from your own application. Stay connected and informed to whatâ€™s important. The EOSPY Executive Order Spy Java Client
is a GPS tracking automation and remote monitoring system that is a complete custom package for your business or office. Its wireless GPS tracking 
allows you to monitor your office, systems, personal property, and business from anywhere in the world. 

Receive information from any number of events like when an employee arrives on-site, where a vehicle is located and even receive remote ambient light intensity, 
temperature, humidity and other information. An alarm is triggered if the SOS button is pressed or the vehicle has exceeded the speed you defined. 
The RPi IoT Tron Java ties all location and environment monitoring information on one GPS Map Screen.

Executive Order Spy â€” This quick guide will help you install and configure the EOSPY â€“ Executive Order Sensor Processor System components.

[] The EOSPY AI-IoT Arduino Tron Server software interface allows you to send commands with the EOSPY AI-IoT software to control external Arduino connected devices.
The AI-IoT Arduino Tron Server software uses a WiFi Wireless Transceiver interface to control and interact with module sensors and remote controls devices. You can 
control any device form the EOSpy AI-IoT Arduino Tron Server software or stream any interface over the WiFi internet. With the EOSpy AI-IoT Arduino Tron Server software
you can automatically turn on lights, appliances, cameras, and open doors from the Drools-jBPM Expert System processing model.

[] The EOSpy AI-IoT Drools-jBPM Expert System provides sophisticated jBPM and drools processing. i.e. On a monitoring application: take an action if the temperature 
on the server room increases X degrees in Y minutes, where sensor readings are usually denoted by events example drools.drl file:
