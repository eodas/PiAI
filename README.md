Pi AI IoT Tron the artificial intelligent voice assistant for your IoT devices control and interaction. Pi AI Tron is an intelligent piece of software for voice communication with all of your IoT devices and machines.

Raspberry Pi AI Tron control smart office automation and monitoring is a voice control for Raspberry Pi AI Tron Things, like the Raspberry Pi Tron IoT Web Cameras.

The Raspberry Pi 4 is probably the easiest and most affordable way to get started with our AI-IoT. An artificial general intelligence and interactive voice assistant for your IoT devices, our powerful Raspberry Pi AI software is a computational knowledge engine. Your internet of things systems of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, shop floor, office automation and field devices can now have the ability of natural human voice interaction. See www.PiIoTTron.com

With our artificial intelligent general knowledge engine for your IoT devices, you can now ask general-knowledge questions from your IoT devices. Our artificial intelligent voice assistant is an intelligent piece of software for communicating with your IoT devices and machines. It gives you natural IoT device control and interaction. Combine this with the vast knowledge of the internet and you will be surprised by how much your business IoT devices can interact with you and the world.

Expanding on the information you now have available, you can ask Pi AI about things like “how the weather or traffic may affect your IoT field tracking devices.” The AI Pi revolutionary interface to your enterprise data and IoT devices allows your employees and customers to access, analyze, and interact with your business data like never before - making information analysis and management broadly available - this kind of information you will need for your competitive advantage.

This is a skill for picroft that will interact with the GPIO

## About 
This Skill demonstrates how to interact with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins using a Mycroft Skill. This Skill shows both reading data from a GPIO port (detecting a button press) and writing data to the port (illuminating an LED). 

### Preparation

[You will need to first install the GPIO libraries for Picroft, and add some additional permissions](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/#using-the-gpio-pins-on-the-raspberry-pi-3).

### Installing from the `makefile`

* Change the Makefile IP address for the RPi installation to the IP address of your RPi. 

That is, edit the file `makefile` using your favorite editor like `nano` or `vi`. 

The line you will need to change is `scp -r * pi@192.168.205.115:/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`. 

Change this to have the IP address of your RPi. 

* Create the folder ```/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio``` on the RPi for the installer. 

You can do this by using the command `mkdir /opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`

* Build the code using the `makefile`.  ```make install.pi```

### Notes

If the LED blinking is too fast, it will be difficult to get a command to execute because there will be a voice response when the the LED turns off and on. Turn the blinking to a lower frequency to be able to execute commands. 

## Using

Once installed on a paired Picroft you should be able to issue commands:

## Examples 
* "Turn Device on"
* "Turn Device off"
* "Blink Device"
* "Device status"

and the Picroft will respond with the following:

```
Led is Off
Led is On
Button Pressed
Button Released
```

## Files

    vocab - This captures entities used by the skill to understand the vocal command.
    dialog - This is used for responces back to the users.

Arduino Tron :: EOSPY-Executive Order Sensor Processor System - Arduino Tron MQTT AI-IoT Client using EOSpy AI-IoT Drools-jBPM

The power of the IoT (Internet of Things) device increases greatly when business process (jBPM) can use them to provide information
about our real-world as well as execute IoT (devices) as part of our business process. The jBPM-BPMN modular allow us to define 
both the Business Processes and IoT Devices Behavior at the same time using one diagram. With EOSpy adding Drools-jBPM to IoT,
we make the IoT devices "smart". Moving beyond just collecting IoT data and transitioning, to leveraging the new wealth of IoT data, 
to improving the smart decision making is the key. Executive Order EOSpy Arduino Tron AI-IoT will help these IoT devices, environments 
and products to self-monitor, self-diagnose and eventually, self-direct.

EOSPY Java - Automation Alert Monitoring - A Java version of the EOSPY – Executive Order Sensor Processor System Client.
 
The Pi AI Tron Java Client application allows you to transmit automation and remote monitoring system information directly to the EOSPY Server 
from your own Java application. Monitor buildings, servers, vehicles and people from anywhere in the world and post there status and condition 
directly to the EOSPY Server from your own application. Stay connected and informed to what is important. The EOSPY Executive Order Spy Java Client
is a GPS tracking automation and remote monitoring system that is a complete custom package for your business or office. Its wireless GPS tracking 
allows you to monitor your office, systems, personal property, and business from anywhere in the world.

[] The EOSPY AI-IoT Arduino Tron Server software interface allows you to send commands with the EOSPY AI-IoT software to control external Arduino connected devices.
The AI-IoT Arduino Tron Server software uses a WiFi Wireless Transceiver interface to control and interact with module sensors and remote controls devices. You can 
control any device form the EOSpy AI-IoT Arduino Tron Server software or stream any interface over the WiFi internet. With the EOSpy AI-IoT Arduino Tron Server software
you can automatically turn on lights, appliances, cameras, and open doors from the Drools-jBPM Expert System processing model.

[] The EOSpy AI-IoT Drools-jBPM Expert System provides sophisticated jBPM and drools processing. i.e. On a monitoring application: take an action if the temperature 
on the server room increases X degrees in Y minutes, where sensor readings are usually denoted by events example drools.drl file:
